# Rules
# The default rule is either OK, warning, critical
default_rule: critical

# Here are the rules each detected access will be compared against
# The first matching rule will be used. If no rule matches, then the default_rule will apply
# Each rule defines parameters (user, address, etc.)
# Each parameter can be either a "hard-coded" value, an alias, or not defined (in this cas, this acts like a wildcard)
